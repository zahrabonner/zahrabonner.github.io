      Hi! My name is Zahra Bonner! I'm a 10th grade student at GEMS World Academy, and this is a webpage that I made for my programming elective! I hope you like it! :)

         I'm very interested in STEM, and my favorite types of sciences are biology and chemistry. I'm also really interested in forensics! I really enjoy learning new things in sciences all the time, and one of my favorite ways to pass time is just watching random science documentaries or doing research on certain topics that I think are interesting! I'm not just a STEM person, though. I'm really into the arts as well! Drawing, photography, and painting are some of my favorite forms of art, but I also really like making things with my hands! Personally, I like the more self developmental activities, such as knitting or sewing. 
      </p>

      Personally, my biggest goal in life is to have options in anything I do. I want to pursue careers simply because I'm interested in them, and not because it's a last-ditch effort that I've made. I feel as though having options is an extremely important part of freedom, so that's why I consider that my biggest goal in life.
      </p>

      I hope you enjoyed reading a little about me! Below, I've put in some pictures that that I've taken!
